# Variable

## Literals

All fixed data (values) that we can use directly in our program called literals. For example `5`, `-20.3`, `'test'`, etc

Different type of literals:

1. Integer Literals - Number without decimal parts.  
   For example: `2`, `-5`, etc
2. Floating-point Literals - Number that have a decimal part.
   For example: `4.25`, `-90.2`, etc
3. Character Literals - A single character that is enclosed within a single quotation marks. For Example: `'N'`, `'a'`, `'}'`, `'*'`, etc

## Declare Variables

1. int
2. double
3. char
   A character variable can only store a single character data. For Example,
   `char alphabet = 'a'`
